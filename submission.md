|    1 | The application pins `requests==2.31.0`, a version affected by known security vulnerabilities (certificate verification bypass and `.netrc` credential leakage). The dependency is outdated relative to current secure releases. | Vulnerable dependencies introduce **supply-chain risk**. Even if the application logic is safe today, a flawed library can allow man-in-the-middle attacks or credential exposure, undermining transport security and trust guarantees. |
|    2 | User-uploaded files are written directly to disk under `/tmp/{filename}` and are never removed after processing. The service accumulates artifacts over time.                                                                    | Persistent file writes enable **disk exhaustion**, potential **information leakage**, and violate least-privilege design. Internal services should minimize filesystem footprint to reduce attack surface and long-term exposure.       |
|    3 | Flask is executed in debug mode, which spawns an additional reloader subprocess (`stat` reloader). This creates a parent/child execution model not explicitly defined in application logic.                                      | Hidden subprocesses create **observability blind spots**. Security monitoring or sandboxing may only track the parent process, allowing unexpected or malicious execution to go unnoticed.                                              |
|    4 | The application runs with `debug=True`, exposing the Werkzeug debugger, printing a debugger PIN, and enabling detailed stack traces.                                                                                             | Debug mode enables **remote code execution** if the debugger is accessed. Even without exploitation, verbose error output leaks sensitive implementation details, making this a **critical misconfiguration**.                          |
|    5 | User-controlled filenames are trusted without sanitization when written to disk, and ZIP archive entries are processed without path traversal checks (e.g., `../`). The design assumes internal trust.                           | Trust boundary violations enable **path traversal**, arbitrary file overwrite, and abuse by compromised upstream components. “Internal service” assumptions fail under lateral movement or insider threat scenarios.                    |
